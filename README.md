# Pokedex [Angular]

## Description
As a Pok√©mon player, I decided to redo the entire pokedex in Angular in order to retrieve the information that I find most interesting when playing the games. Quite often, the pokedexes you find on the Internet aren't necessarily very aesthetic or don't contain all the information I'm looking for on the same page. That's why I decided to create this project. The aim of the fund is also to improve my Angular skills and show them off.

## Data
All the information is retrieved via the "PokeAPI" API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/).

## Development version
This project was generated with Angular CLI (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.14.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Review 
Don't hesitate to give me feedback or to criticise what I've done - any advice is welcome!
